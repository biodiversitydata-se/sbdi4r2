Description: SBDI provides tools to enable users of biodiversity 
    information to find, access, combine and visualise Swedish data on
    plants, animals and fungi; these have been made available from
    <https://biodiversitydata.se/>. sbdi4r2 provides a subset of the tools based on the 
    galah package, and a few functions custom made for Sweden, which can be 
    directly used within R. It enables the R community to directly access data 
    and resources hosted by the SBDI. Our goal is to enable observations 
    of species to be queried, and output in a range of standard formats.
